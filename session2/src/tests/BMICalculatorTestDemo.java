/*
 * This class calculates the body mass index (BMI), which is defined as the body mass
 * divided by the square of the body height. The BMI provides a simple numeric measure
 * of a personâ€™s thickness or thinness, and the current value recommendations are as follow
 *  a BMI from 18.5 up to 25 may indicate optimal weight, a BMI lower than 18.5 suggests the person
 *  is underweight, a number from 25 up to 30 may indicate the person is overweight, and a
 *  number from 30 upwards suggests the person is obese. If the BMI is more than 40 the person is considered very obese.
